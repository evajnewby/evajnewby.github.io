    "text": "Eva Newby is a graduate student in the UC Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, working towards a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science. Eva graduated with Regents Scholar distinction from UC Davis (2019) with a B.S. in Animal Science and a specialization in Animal Behavior. Since graduation, she has been volunteering at North America’s largest refugee camp in Tijuana, Mexico and working as a biologist in the environmental consulting field. In addition to her responsibilities as a biologist, Eva became the head drone pilot for the Southern California region, exposing her to even more of California’s diverse ecosystems. Drone imagery data synthesis initially sparked her interest in the data science field, and the curiosity to use data science to further inform sound environmental decision making drove her to apply to the Bren School. Eva additionally plans to use her data science skills to help address food insecurity in impoverished communities.\nOutside of her professional career, Eva enjoys the great outdoors through surfing, biking, rock climbing, snowboarding, hiking, and petting as many friendly animals as possible."
